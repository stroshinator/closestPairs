# closestPairs
This project demonstrates an efficient algorithm that finds the closest (Euclidean distance) pairs of points in a set Q of n >= 2 points. This algorithm runs in O(n lg n) time as compared to the brute force option O(n^2).

This program was written in Python and reads text files containing the coordinates of the points. Each text file has a different number of points to demonstrat the efficiency of this algorithm. This algorithm is based on the description in Chapter 33.4, pg. 1039 of "Introduction to Algorithms" Third Edition by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.
